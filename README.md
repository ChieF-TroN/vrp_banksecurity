You can configure the script in server.lua

Configuration Options:

Kick/Ban Toggle

Amount of Money Over Set Value Trigger Kick/Ban.

Discord Webhook


Please note that if you do not have your Give Money limited you could get users banned because they gave more money then the set amount.

Also note that this only checks their Wallet and not their Bank. This is intended for catching people using LUA injectors to give themselves money.
